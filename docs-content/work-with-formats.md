# Handle FHIR, X12, C-CDA, JSON and text

A channel's `format` says how its transform receives each message. The message is stored as it
arrived; it is parsed in the channel's worker, right before the transform runs.

| `format`          | The transform receives                               | Type                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `hl7v2` (default) | an `Hl7Message` from `@cosyte/hl7`                   | `TransformFor<"hl7v2">` |
| `fhir`            | a FHIR R4 resource from `@cosyte/fhir`'s JSON reader | `TransformFor<"fhir">`  |
| `x12`             | an `X12Interchange` from `@cosyte/x12`               | `TransformFor<"x12">`   |
| `ccda`            | a `CcdaDocument` from `@cosyte/ccda`                 | `TransformFor<"ccda">`  |
| `json`            | the value `JSON.parse` returns                       | `TransformFor<"json">`  |
| `text`            | the body as a string                                 | `TransformFor<"text">`  |

FHIR, X12, C-CDA and JSON are read as UTF-8, and a body that is not valid UTF-8 fails to parse rather
than being changed in silence. `text` turns bytes that are not UTF-8 into U+FFFD. A `json` body with a
number that a JavaScript number cannot hold exactly (a long id, say) fails with `INEXACT_JSON_NUMBER`
rather than being rounded; use `text` to pass it through untouched.

A message that does not parse is marked failed with the parser's stable code, such as
`NO_MSH_SEGMENT` or `X12_NO_ISA_HEADER`, and the transform never sees it.

MLLP carries HL7 v2 only, so a channel with an MLLP source or destination keeps `format: hl7v2`.

## Read a FHIR resource

```ts runnable title="channels/patients-in/transform.ts"
import { resourceType } from "@cosyte/fhir";
import type { TransformFor } from "@cosyte/pathways";

// Patients go on; any other resource is filtered out.
export default ((resource) =>
  resourceType(resource) === "Patient" ? resource : null) satisfies TransformFor<"fhir">;
```

The resource is `@cosyte/fhir`'s immutable model, which keeps every decimal exactly as written. To
call a library's helpers, install it in the project (`npm install @cosyte/fhir`).

## Read an X12 interchange

```ts runnable title="channels/claims-in/transform.ts"
import type { TransformFor } from "@cosyte/pathways";

// Only interchanges that carry a claim group (GS-01 HC) go on.
export default ((interchange) =>
  interchange.groups.some((group) => group.gs.elements[1] === "HC")
    ? interchange
    : null) satisfies TransformFor<"x12">;
```

## Turn one format into another

What a transform returns is written back like this, whatever the channel's format:

- a string is sent as it is, in UTF-8;
- bytes (a `Uint8Array`, which a `Buffer` is) are sent exactly as they are, so a body in another
  character set, such as Latin-1, or a binary one keeps its bytes;
- a model from `@cosyte/hl7`, `@cosyte/fhir`, `@cosyte/x12` or `@cosyte/ccda` is written by its own
  library;
- on a `json` channel, a plain object, an array, a number or a boolean is written with
  `JSON.stringify`.

So a transform can take one format in and send another out. This one turns an HL7 v2 admission into
a FHIR Patient:

```ts runnable title="channels/adt-to-fhir/transform.ts"
import type { Transform } from "@cosyte/pathways";

export default ((msg) => {
  if (!msg.is("ADT^A01")) return null;
  const patient = {
    resourceType: "Patient",
    identifier: [{ value: msg.get("PID.3.1") }],
    name: [{ family: msg.get("PID.5.1"), given: [msg.get("PID.5.2")] }],
  };
  return JSON.stringify(patient);
}) satisfies Transform;
```

The channel's format still names what comes in, and so it sets the file extension a file destination
writes and the `Content-Type` an HTTP destination sends. Set the header for what goes out:

```yaml title="channels/adt-to-fhir/channel.yaml"
format: hl7v2
source:
  file: { dir: ../../data/adt-to-fhir/in }
transform: ./transform.ts
destinations:
  - http:
      url: https://fhir.example.com/Patient
      headers:
        Content-Type: application/fhir+json
        Authorization: { env: FHIR_SERVER_AUTH }
```
